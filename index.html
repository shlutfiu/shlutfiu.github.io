    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     During my education in the field of computer science and many years of experience in Information
Technology, I realized that Cyber ​​Security is today the most challenging field. The year 2016 was a turning
point when I began to actively engage in this field with the establishment of the National Cyber ​​Security Unit
(KOS-CERT) based on the legislation in force which states that ARKEP should also perform the functions
of the Computer Emergency Response Center to deal with cyber threats in public electronic communication
networks and services.
<p>Although challenging, this unit was created step by step by developing technical and legal capacities based on
best practices and projects implemented by international organizations. Now KOS-CERT performs its
functions at the national level and is also internationally recognized by being accredited in the TF-CSIRT. In
recent years, Kosovo has made efforts to complete the legal framework in the field of cybersecurity, where I
was part of the working groups in the drafting of the first National Cybersecurity Strategy and Action Plan
and later in the drafting of the Law on Cybersecurity, and other secondary legislation. Being a member of the
National Cybersecurity Council, my contribution within this council is in making important decisions related
to cybersecurity at the national level.</p>
My commitment to this field has also continued in the academic aspect, having been engaged as a professor at
AAB College for more than 12 years, as well as continuing my academic advancement in obtaining my
Doctorate degree.
